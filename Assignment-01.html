            <h2>7-DAY HEALTHY MEAL PLAN</h2>

            <p>Lazy days of summer!!! I love them- I don’t have the often, but when I do I love spending time at the beach or poolside. Make those days easier by meal prepping lunches early in the week with a Savory Cottage Cheese Bowl or Low Yolk Egg Salad if you are relaxing at home, or try my BLT Roll Ups with Turkey and Avocado for a easy, portable lunch.</p>
